# Topics
* Discuss options for storing an evolving list of values. Array (doesn't really work because fixed size). Better options: vector and linked list
* Intro to linked lists: We'll start with a C-style implementation focussing on the concept of creating and modifying a linked chain
* Create an empty list and write a function to append a new node to the linked list
* Print the elements of the list: key concept includes iterating over the nodes of the linked list using a traversal pointer
