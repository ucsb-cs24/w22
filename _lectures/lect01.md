# Topics

* Course overview 
	- why study data structures, C++ and git?
	- what are the goals of this class?
* Discuss options for storing an evolving list of values. Array (doesn't really work because fixed size). Better options: vector and linked list
* Intro to linked lists: We'll start with a C-style implementation focussing on the concept of creating and modifying a linked chain
* Create an empty list and write a function to append a new node to the linked list
